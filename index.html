        <p class="lead">I'm sharing advice</p>

        <p>Hello Team,</p>
        <p>As a regular contributor to this sub, a professional resume writer, and former corporate recruiter, I'd like to share the most common mistakes I see folks make.</p>

        <p>This isn't an exhaustive list and isn't in any particular order. These are big mistakes that are potentially causing you to lose out on valuable opportunities and correcting them should improve the overall performance of your job search.</p>

        <!-- Search functionality -->
        <div class="mb-3">
          <input type="text" class="form-control" ng-model="searchText" placeholder="Search mistakes..." />
        </div>

        <!-- Mistakes list with dynamic content using AngularJS -->
        <div ng-repeat="mistake in mistakes | filter:searchText">
          <h3 class="mt-5" ng-click="toggleDetail($index)">
            #{{$index + 1}} {{mistake.title}} <span ng-if="!mistake.showDetail">[+]</span><span ng-if="mistake.showDetail">[-]</span>
          </h3>
          <p ng-show="mistake.showDetail">{{mistake.description}}</p>

          <div class="highlight" ng-if="mistake.details && mistake.showDetail">
            <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> {{mistake.details.shortAnswer}}</p>
            <p><strong>Longer Answer:</strong> {{mistake.details.longAnswer}}</p>
